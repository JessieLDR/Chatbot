# Chatbot

A program that accepts a topic as a string input from the user, searches the internet for information about it, and answers any questions regarding the topic. - Try to use your imagination to make the program more interesting and useful. - Feel free to use the languages and technologies with which you feel most comfortable. - Incorporate the standards and best practices you are familiar with. - Document the code (add comments as appropriate) - Provide instructions to run the code. 

Install Dependencies: Install the necessary libraries such as BeautifulSoup, requests, and google-cloud-language using pip.


Retrieve Information: Use web scraping techniques to search the internet for information related to the user's input topic. You can make use of search engines like Google or Wikipedia to retrieve relevant web pages or articles.


Extract Relevant Information: Analyze the retrieved web pages and extract relevant information using BeautifulSoup. Focus on headings, paragraphs, and other relevant sections to gather the most important details.


Question Analysis: Implement a natural language processing algorithm to analyze user questions. You can use Google's Natural Language API to perform sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and syntactic parsing to better understand the user's queries.


Answering Questions: Based on the user's input, extract the relevant information from the retrieved web pages and provide concise and accurate answers to the questions. You may need to preprocess the user's question and compare it with the extracted information to generate a relevant response.


User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface to accept user input and display the program's responses. This can be a command-line interface or a graphical user interface (GUI) depending on your preference.


Documentation: Add inline comments in the code to explain its functionality and document any dependencies, instructions, or limitations of the program.
